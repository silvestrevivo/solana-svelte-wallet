# solana-svelte-wallet

This is part of the **Icarus Initiative** to learn Solana. This project is build on SvelteKit, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## To run the project

```bash
# clone the project
git clone git@github.com:silvestrevivo/solana-svelte-wallet.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd solana-svelte-wallet

# install all node packages
npm install

# run the wallet on localhost:3000
npm run dev
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
