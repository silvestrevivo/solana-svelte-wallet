# solana-svelte-wallet

This is part of the **Icarus Initiative** to learn Solana. This project is build on SvelteKit, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## To run the project

```bash
# clone the project
git clone git@github.com:silvestrevivo/solana-svelte-wallet.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd solana-svelte-wallet

# install all node packages
npm install

# run the wallet on localhost:3000
npm run dev
```

## Things to take in consideration

This is an exercise to learn how __Svelte__ works with __Solana__ in the frontend side. The wallet is running in the __DEVNET__, and that means that is not operating with real money. Some features like _QRcode_ recognition and wallet recovery are 'nice to have'. If you want to contribute, feel free to open a PR :).
